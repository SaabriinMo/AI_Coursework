website we used to help code the model:

https://github.com/ItsWajdy/tensorflow-tutorials/blob/master/Basic%20Classification.py -> i refactored the code to it's able to plot the imagaes and see the results!


https://github.com/rois-codh/kmnist -> I used the balanced accuracy score to get the accuracy of the models.
