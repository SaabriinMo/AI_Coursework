# AI_Coursework

website we used to help code the model:

https://github.com/ItsWajdy/tensorflow-tutorials/blob/master/Basic%20Classification.py -> i got the inspiration from this to  plot the images and see the results of the cnn model !

https://github.com/rois-codh/kmnist -> I used the balanced accuracy score to get the accuracy of the models.


Make sure you have the following version installed:

> tensorflow == 2.0.0-alpha0
> keras == 2.2.4
> numpy == 1.18.1
> matlibplot == 3.1.3

-- This is what verisons i have installed

You may choose to run the code, please ensure you have both juypter notebooks. Since the code was split, you may need to combine the 2 juypter notbook to get the full picture. Also, you may obtain different results from the time the report was created. Just make sure you keep this in mind.
